# Signal Detection Theory model with random criteria

When applying Signal Detection Theory (SDT) to human data, it is possible, that the criterion for positive responses varies during an experiment, or between sessions. I will be developing a simple hierarchical model for modelling this criterial variability. 

The first step taken here is a simple model with fixed overall sensitivity and a single fixed criterion in N bins of length n.
